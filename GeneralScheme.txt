Information for every possible permutation is not stored. Instead, we iterate through permutations.
For every permutation we replay the game up to this point. Then, based on the current state of the 
permutation, summary stastics are saved.

TODO: Experiment with pruning. Every kill action can rule out up to at least (n-2)! permutations, so we may have significant savings very quickly. On the other hand, keeping track of the permutations to skip may be prohibitively expensive.
